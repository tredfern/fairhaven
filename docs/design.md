# Fairhaven, the RPG Village Simulator Game Design

## Concept

You start with an overrun/abandoned village. You put up ads/quests for heroes to come help you out, they go off on their own and complete the quest (or die) and get XP and you have to pay them, but that unlocks new things for your village to do. Which then leads to bigger monsters threatening the village, leading to more quests, rinse/repeat until you either buff up some heroes enough to defeat the big bad thing or you are overrun.

In remembering and researching this game, I came across some interesting comments in the steam reviews:

> Why isn't there a proper successor to this masterpiece? I grieve! I mourn for these little islands of ingenious game design that get left behind in the endless forward march of popular video game culture. There's nothing like it. If you're into esoteric game design, or a bit of PC historian, you would be remiss to not experience this.

> It would be really great to have a Majesty-like game with a reasonable and enjoyable level design. Unfortunatelly, it hasn't happened yet.

>One of the reasons I recommend this game is the fact that it differs from other strategy games. If you're a casual strategy player who doesn't want to control every single unit or gather resources manually then this game is for you.
>
> Majesty is mostly focused on which buildings you make, especially during the start of a level. The heroes will explore the map on their own. They fight and gather items, and if the enemy they're facing is too strong they flee. They also upgrade their armor and weapons automatically but only if you build a blacksmith and research the upgrades. That means you don't have to worry about anything except making the right buildings. If you feel like ordering the units to search a specific location on the map you can add a bounty flag which will make the units move there to get the reward.

> Wow. This game is so cool. There are no other games like this around, which is a dang shame, because this really was an awesome idea. This old game still holds up against more modern strategy games and is definitely still unique over a decade after its release. Buy this, its such steal at this price. Support it so a decent sequel may be put into development. I just wish my freaking wizards would suvive to level 3.
_Zelda_ 

![Zelda](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k2mut1s5xt0136k/Kakariko-Village-Sign.png?raw=1)

The classic RPG adventure game. Getting to the village was always great because you knew some quests were going to happen.

_Ultima_ 

![Ultima](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xjs1ry6492my4gx/Ultima5_location_town_Yew0.png?raw=1)

Another classic. The towns in all the Ultima games were one of the unique things that I think brought those games to life
with the limited abilities/memory of computers at that time. The story dealt a lot with the interactions with the NPC
to drive you to the next encounter/opportunity. More so than just going into Dungeon XX because that is the next on the
list. It made the game hard to solve because what order did you need to solve the game in?

**Doodle a picture/sketch for the project**

I did not create this picture, but this is a good example of what's in my mind's eye:

**What is FUN about this project? This can be fun for you to do, and/or fun to play!**

All those RPG games focus on you the hero coming to town and saving the day! But how many heroes came before you and didn't succeed? What happened to the town after the hero left
to continue their quest. This is a chance to tell that story. About the REAL MVP. The village that provided the quests and resources to that party(s) of adventurers. They worked the lumber camp, cooked the meals, made the beds, enchanted the items, trained the warriors, created the scrolls, forged the weapons and armor, built the fortifications. Without them, the hero wouldn't survive 10 minutes in the level 1 dungeon.

## Create

**What themes are possible?**

Jennevieve had a great thought about the theme of refugees and working together. How we must cooperate to overcome the evils of the world.

**What styles are possible?**

Not sure, other than a top-down view of the village. Various tropes from Fantasy worlds being present. How to keep it somewhat interesting will be a question mark. 

**Put together a color palette that fits your mood for this project**

From [Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list/daydreams24)

**What emotions should the game invoke?**

A bit of hope and calm, with periods of frantic defense. Some disappointment when heroes
fail on their objectives.

**Is there a world? Describe how it works**

World will be a bit of a standard RPG Fantasy universe. Details can be worked out over time
for the details of the world and how it operates. Maybe a kind of funny way of approaching
this is that heroes are constantly being created in the universe. Like the came out doors,
portals from other dimensions to save the world. 

**Is there a story? How does it go? What is the perspective? What arc does it follow?**
[Kurt Vonnegut's 5 story arcs](http://msmcclure.com/pdf/Five%20Story%20Arcs.pdf)
[More story arc information](https://nofilmschool.com/2016/11/emotional-arcs-6-storytelling-kurt-vonnegut)

Story should follow the standard "Kill the Monster" arc. Similar to this ![HP](https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2016/577e4aca3dd97.jpg)

The ups and downs can be attributed to when a new thing is unlocked, that's great. New peak has appeared and options open up. The following waves of monsters/challenges get increasingly challenging until the village can arrange the correct group to go and take care of the challenge that is tormenting them. Unlocking new options again, only to be plunged back into more difficulties. Eventually, the confrontation with the End Boss occurs. Likely happening in the village itself, where the village comes together and takes down the bad guy on their own to save the world.

**Money is not always a goal for projects, but it is worth considering if you are going to make income from this, how might you go about that? Continuous support from loyal fans, sales on a platform, advertisements?**

A framework like this could lead to many different types of villages, arcs, and villains. This could also be adapted to Sci-Fi universes. Finally, a good RPG Village Simulator could be the foundation of a dynamic RPG where the player can now be a hero in this world where the villagers are active participants.

## Risks

**What are some unanswered questions for you right now?**

- How does the player interface with the game? Are they represented as an avatar or do they focus on interacting with the buildings and other interface items?
- There needs to be some leader for the village, (Elder, Mayor, etc...) is that the player? Or is that just a leader that can have interesting impact on the game?

**What skills do you need to complete this project successfully?**

- Lots of art, lots of marketing

**What is the hardest part about this project?**

- Getting to a foundational fun mechanic. Which is maybe no different from any other game, but with that mechanic in place, the next biggest challenge will be generating enough interesting and balanced content.

**How committed are you to the project? What can you do to help stay focused on the project?**

Feeling great about it today. It is an extension/modification of another project idea that was also exciting to me. 

**What additional/outside help do you need to complete the project?**

- Art to present that compelling interactions with the world. 
- Ability to create a community around the project

**What are the ways that the project fails?**

- Technology seems low risk. Almost any game framework/engine should be able to support this
- Compelling content and story could be a challenge

**How big does the project feel?**

- Very large, but it does seem small to get a framework working.

**What is SCARY about this project?**

Getting distracted on the many possible ideas and missing the core idea. There are so many potential good ideas in here that it would be easy to throw a lot of things on top that do not add compelling content to the game but distract the player from the fun they should feel.

**What dependencies exist for this project? Are you working on this with multiple people? Do you need a specific library or technology to be released?**

No dependencies at this time

## Breaking it Down

### Scoping

1. There is a village on the screen that the player can interact with
2. There are villagers that live in this village that perform various tasks depending on their occupation
3. Heroes come to the village at various intervals. Unsure what might result in heroes showing up. Heroes will show up at levels that are close to the level of the village. 
4. Ability to hire Heroes to accomplish tasks. Some of the resources/goods that the villages create will be used to pay the heroes to take care of jobs the villagers cannot do. This cost needs to be significant enough that it limits what the player can do directly in the village. For example, maybe you give them the reward of a magic shield, but that prevents the shield from being bought from your town and limits the amount of gold you have.
5. Monsters establish lairs on the map. These lairs will periodically spawn waves of attackers to the town.
6. Monsters attacking the town will have some objective that is usually not just "Kill Them All". They might kidnap someone, or steal a valuable heirloom, or demand tribute from the villagers. Think of this as the monsters are getting _quests_ to attack the town.
7. Monster attacks will open up new quest possibilities. `Go retrieve my ancient sword of water breathing`, `Save my son!`, or `Retrieve our food` 
8. When lairs are destroyed the heroes will return with some artifact that is useless for them but would be helpful for the village. The artifacts will be resources that allow the village to upgrade. Or maybe they are skilled workers that can unlock new buildings/occupations in the town.


### Milestones

**1. Prototype**

  - Basic rectangle shapes representing a building and some villagers.
  - Some resource collection points that villagers will go to
  - A monster lair that spawns enemies that come and steal resources
  - A hero that comes by and can accept a quest to go attack the monster lair
  - Feedback

**2. Foundations**

Put together those foundational pieces that are learned from the prototype so the game can be actively developed.

  - Essential frameworks for graphics, sound, and music
  - User interface and experience design work
  - Concept art
  - Layout of the screens for the game
  - Feedback

**3. Playable beginning**

Something that can show how the game would start out. Very basic beginnings and getting a village off the ground and operating.

  - Core questing mechanics
  - Core building mechanics
  - Core monster mechanics
  - Core hero mechanics
  - Feedback

**4. Playable Ending**

Jump to the victory/losing conditions and focus on the game as complexity has ramped up. Keeping the game feeling fun with many things unlocked and lots of bits interacting. It might not have everything that the ending will eventually need, but start figuring out the ending point.

  - Build enough content to get a rough arc to the game
  - Feedback from external community

**5. Game time (Alpha Version)**

Connect everything together to give a feeling of a good arc to the game. 

  - Fill in enough content that it becomes a playable game

**6. Beta Launch**

The game should feel solid enough that it is able to get constant feedback and updates from players that are interested in a game still before the final release.

  - Enough content that it is an intriguing game
  - Rebalancing content to make sure all the new mechanics are working well together

**7. Launch**

The game is in a state that it can be released as a first version. Things will be cut, and more ideas are possible, but the game is something to be proud of.
